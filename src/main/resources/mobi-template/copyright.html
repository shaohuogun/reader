<i>Java</i> is a language and a platform based on a 
virtual machine and execution environment. The Java 
language offers many language features; the Java 
platform offers a wealth of APIs. There's much to 
learn and the list of language features/APIs grows 
with each new Java release.<br><br>

Perhaps you've been working with Java for some time 
and would like to assess your Java knowledge level. 
To help you with this task, I've developed a 
150-question Java quiz that challenges you on many 
aspects of Java Platform, Standard Edition. This 
quiz focuses on Java SE 1 through Java SE 7.<br><br>

I've organized this Java quiz into interleaved 
true/false and multiple choice categories. To help 
you quickly determine if you've answered a question 
correctly, I've listed the question's answer on the 
page immediately following the question page. I 
hope you find this quiz helpful.
